**Basic Idea of the Game**

* After the game starts, the ‘time left’ will start from an appropriate number, such as 100 seconds
* The ‘time left’ will be reduced by 1 every second
* The player needs to reach a particular exit point (i.e. an exit) before the time becomes zero
* If the time runs out before the player reaches the exit point, the player dies
* If the player reaches the exit before the time runs out, the time remaining is added to the player’s score
